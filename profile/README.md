# MesoS2D

The primary objective of MesoS2D is:
To quantify the physical drivers of mesosphere variability at all timescales, opening a
pathway to improved predictability of weather and climate processes in the Earth system.
Our project builds from regional observationally-driven studies to whole-atmospheric dynamical-
science advances via four closely-linked sub-objectives. We will:

 Identify and quantify the key physical drivers of observed mesosphere variability, as driven
by mechanisms above, below and in-situ.
Characterize MLTI variability at timescales from hours to decades over Scandinavia, an
exceptionally well-instrumented testbed region where we will benefit directly from NERCâ€™s
recent investment in the state-of-the-art EISCAT-3D (E3D) radar.
Based on these quantified drivers, develop and implement the improvements needed to
advance mesosphere predictability in the WACCM global atmospheric model, and provide
the insight needed to apply this to other models. 
Use our observations and new model capabilities to quantify how the mesosphere couples
to and preconditions dynamical variability in the ionosphere and underlying atmosphere,
with impacts for GNSS, radio communications, and weather prediction.
